Analysing dataset data 

Hypothesis 1: Enjoyment (DV1) will be greater in the game condition than the task condition.
    A one-tailed two-sample t-test will be used to test whether the mean scores of DV1 is greater
    in the game condition than the task condition. α = 0.05.

Hypothesis 2: Proportion of valid data (DV2(a)) will be lower in the game condition than the
    task condition. A two-tailed two-sample t-test will be used to test whether the mean scores of
    DV2(a) is less in the game condition than the task condition. α = 0.05

Hypothesis 3: Proportion of valid data-providing mechanic actuations (DV2(b)) will be greater
    in the game condition than what would be expected if ordering was random. A two-tailed one-sample
    t-test will be used to compare DV2 for the game condition against the theoretical mean expected if
    players provided word orderings that were completely random. This is given below. α = 0.05

    Theoretical random proportion = (valid permutations / total permutations of 3 words) = 1/6 = 16.67%

Hypothesis 3 (altered): Proportion of valid data-providing mechanic actuations (measured using _correctform)
    will be greater in the game condition than what would be expected if ordering was random. A two-tailed one-sample
    t-test will be used to compare DV2 for the game condition against the theoretical mean expected if
    players provided word orderings that were completely random. This is given below. α = 0.05
