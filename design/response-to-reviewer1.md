1. I don't think I saw a consent form - is there one? 

No, there is no separate consent form. As I note in Section 6 Consent:

    Detailed study and consent information will be included in the study description on Prolific. By clicking to begin the study, they indicate their consent. The description provided to participants is supplied in the attached file description.md.

I previously clarified this point to Siamak by email, and I include this below:

    Participants on Prolific are able to choose whether or not to participate in a study based on the study's title and description as well as the expected time taken, payment offered, and number of participant slots remaining. Before choosing to participate, they are shown the study description, which should give all the information needed in a consent form/information sheet. This is to avoid wasting participant time as they might otherwise drop out after first seeing this information within the study questionnaire/task itself. It also avoids having to refuse payment for as many incomplete sessions.

    A participant that is delivered to the study by Prolific (as opposed to for some reason stumbling upon the direct url) is associated with a Prolific participant ID (supplied via a GET parameter). Thus if a participant has such a number, we know they have come from Prolific and chosen there to begin the study. In the unlikely event that a participant arrives without such a number their data would be destroyed.

    The cost of running the study on Prolific is based on the average completion time of the task. While I have over-estimated this to avoid participants rushing, in general I want to minimise the time the participant spends on the study: both to minimise cost, and avoid wasting the participants' time. This is why I want to avoid duplicating the study information and consent at the beginning of the study. It would be more screens of text to read through.

    In other words, I believe participants have supplied informed consent by reading the description and choosing to begin the study. I have an indirect record of this (in the form of a participant arriving to the study with a prolific participant ID). Specifically with regard to the GDPR, under the "public task" justification of the GDPR, a record of consent is not necessary for data processing (which is itself only applicable until it is anonymised and thus ceases to be personal data under the definition of the GDPR).


2. Is this study done online or in person?

Online. 


3. Is the payment integral to the study - if not, then it is uncomfortable to suggest to participants that they will not be paid if they withdraw, as there could be many reasons to do so that should not be 'punished.' If payment is part of the study in some way, then this would be a different matter.

Prolific, an online research panel provider is being used to recruit and pay participants. Studies run through Prolific pay after completion of a study. Usually, when a participant drops out, revokes their data through Prolific's online interface, or does not 'properly' complete the study (such as failing reasonable checks that they are paying attention, though I do not include any of these), payment is refused. Prolific has a policy where participant rewards must be a fair payment for the work performed. Payment on completion is the standard that participants on Prolific expect.

Many if not most participants are participating primarily in order to be paid (exactly in the way that most workers work because they are paid). Participating in the experiment online offers many ways to 'game the system' - for example signing up and immediately dropping out - whilst simultaneously lowering the social consequences for violating the social norms of being a 'good participant'. As the experiment is performed online, it is impractical to distinguish those participants who have a legitimate reason for non-completion (i.e. where they can reasonably be considered to have done the work for which they were to be paid, for example if a techinical reason prevents them submitting their data) from those who do not (who drop out upon starting, for example). Thus, allowing participants who drop out to get the full payment would possibly lead to a significant increase in cost with less data collected. 

It is uncomfortable to suggest payment may be withdrawn perhaps because we are not used to participants being primarily motivated financially or taking part in experiments as a way to supliment their income. Research participants tend to be students, and are likely to be from relativly privalaged backgrounds. They are also likely to place a higher importance on the value of research and 'being a good participant'. This frees us to think of payment as only a "reward" and avoids us having to think of ourselves as employers retaining work in exchange for pay. Unfortunately this is not possible on an online environment where the best analogy is the gig economy. Wage labour in general, and particularly within the gig economy (as Prolific should be classified), raises legitimate ethical questions. People who supliment their income on Prolific, or example, do not recieve holiday or sickness benefits. Also, when labour is waged, employers must rely on some way to measure that a person can reasonably be considered to have done the work paid for, that is, they have fulfilled their end of the contract, and if not, possibly withhold pay (an employee who shows up late for work may be docked pay, for example). Typically throughout the gig economy (e.g. Uber, Deliveroo), as well as in the trades (e.g. plumbing) payment is only for tasks that are completed, regardless of the potentially legitimate reasons that prevented completion of a task.

It is possible for participants to contact me via Prolific's website or appeal to Prolific if they believe they have been unfairly treated. It is Prolific's policy that if researchers are unfairly penalising participants then the researcher's account is suspended until bonus payments are made to participants to make up for the unpaid time.

4. There is some detail on a 'Prolific ID' - is this something that's important to the study, does the participant need to know, why is it there?

Each user on Prolific is associated with a pseudoonumous ID, a number that uniquely identifies them to Prolific. This is the only information about a participant that Prolfic supplies to the researcher (except for the demographic filters that they must have satisfied to be selected). Its only use is for managing the study and cannot be used to infer any information about the participant. This ID will be colleted by me alongside the participants' data from the study (i.e. with the participant's answers). This makes it possible to identify which participants have completed the study and which have dropped out.

On the Prolific website, I will be shown a list of participant IDs who have undertaken the study. I will compare it against the data I have collected and choose to pay any for whom I have data (i.e. who have completed the study). I will refuse payment for those for whom I have no data, as this means they did not complete the study.


5. My sense is that this is a simple and non-controversial study from an ethics perspective that is not well described - to be sure of this, can the content be looked at again please and simplified?

Can you indicate which parts of the content need to be clarified or simplified? I am happy to elaborate any aspect in more detail as on the application form I was limited by a word count.
